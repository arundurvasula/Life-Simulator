Purpose:
This program attempts to create a model with which to simulate prokaryotic life.

Usage:
To use this program, you need to create a python file and import the environment and 
organism objects.

from environment import Environment
from organism import Organism

Next you need to parse the FASTA file that holds your genome information. There is an
example in the test_population.py file.
